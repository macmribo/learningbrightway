The flowable and context input files for TRACI 2.1 are used by the LCIA Formatter to translate the names from the TRACI 2.1 source file and generate a mapping file for the FEDEFL. This file contains all of the accepted flowable and context combinations which can be mapped to TRACI 2.1 characterization factors. It also includes target UUID, units, and conversion factors as well as tracking who mapped and verified each record and when they were last updated.\n\nAdditional flowable mappings were included for general metals (e.g. Copper, Zinc, and Selenium) in the FEDEFL to the most common ions where available in TRACI 2.1 (e.g. COPPER(II), ZINC(II), and SELENIUM(IV)). This ensures the application of TRACI 2.1 characterization factors when the general name of the metal is reported, as is the case in EPA datasets such as NEI and TRI.\n\nDuplicate names for flowables exist in TRACI 2.1 which have different characterization factors and different CAS. These occur due to duplicate entries in the source files for USEtox. In these cases, the entries with the currently recognized CAS are accepted and the other flowables are ignored.\n\nFEDEFL contexts are mapped to TRACI 2.1 to enable impact assessment across most of the possible contexts available within FEDEFL. Mappings that occur in the primary contexts (e.g. air) are assigned to all possible sub-contexts which apply. Where a context is non-specific in FEDEFL relative to the available TRACI 2.1 contexts (e.g. rural/urban), the LCIA Formatter applies the average of the relevant characterization factors from TRACI 2.1.\n\nNormalization and weighting factors are not provided in the TRACI 2.1 source file and are not added here.","version":"00.00.000","impactCategories":[{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"8c5a0a4c-ea1a-33b6-a973-43988d1b61f4","name":"Eutrophication","refUnit":"kg N eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"cdced312-e381-31c7-9a62-309fa62b3ba2","name":"Smog formation","refUnit":"kg O3 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"0a8ce516-20fa-3b01-bbbe-c0b8cb4e4c63","name":"Human health - cancer","refUnit":"CTUcancer"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"2888aa63-f97b-3407-b56e-4d103dc1246d","name":"Freshwater ecotoxicity","refUnit":"CTUeco"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"d21c7132-2861-3d6b-9bc8-590627a087b4","name":"Global warming","refUnit":"kg CO2 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"6037e49a-4adb-3a31-a23d-c82569e3242f","name":"Acidification","refUnit":"kg SO2 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"264097d3-cd2c-3d75-998a-f170ab543c9a","name":"Ozone depletion","refUnit":"kg CFC-11 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"cfb3b79b-2141-3357-91d4-b8e3f00586d4","name":"Human health - particulate matter","refUnit":"PM 2.5 eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"4635115b-b3bd-3883-825b-fb0eab57381f","name":"Human health - non-cancer","refUnit":"CTUnoncancer"}]}

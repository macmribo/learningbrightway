The flowable and context input files for ReCiPe 1.1 are used by the LCIA Formatter to translate the names from the ReCiPe 1.1 source file and generate a mapping file for the FEDEFL. This file contains all of the accepted flowable and context combinations which can be mapped to ReCiPe 1.1 characterization factors. It also includes target UUID, units, and conversion factors as well as tracking who mapped and verified each record and when they were last updated.\n\nFEDEFL contexts are mapped to ReCiPe 1.1 to enable impact assessment across most of the possible contexts available within FEDEFL. Mappings that occur in the primary contexts (e.g. air) are assigned to all possible sub-contexts which apply. Where a context is non-specific in FEDEFL relative to the available ReCiPe 1.1 contexts (e.g. rural/urban), the LCIA Formatter applies the average of the relevant characterization factors from ReCiPe 1.1.\n\nThe LCIA Formatter generates a separate impact assement method for each of the three approaches employed in ReCiPe 1.1, which includes Individualist, Hierarchist, and Egalitarian. More details on the methods can be found on the website https://www.rivm.nl/en/life-cycle-assessment-lca/downloads \n\nThis mapping is representative of ReCiPe 1.1 midpoint impact factors and endpoint conversion factors are not included here.\n\nReCiPe 2016 v1.1 midpoint method, Hierarchist version. This is the typical ReCiPe midpoint method.","version":"00.00.000","impactCategories":[{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"b634e6c9-4aed-3891-92e5-c3f5dd8e5077","name":"Marine ecotoxicity","refUnit":"1,4-DCB eq. emitted to seawater"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"315c214e-cf2a-318b-94e0-f62b526044ae","name":"Marine eutrophication","refUnit":"kg N-eq to marine water"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"167eec76-58a0-3e5b-aeb6-0c304b895485","name":"Human carcinogenic toxicity","refUnit":"1,4-DCB eq. emitted to urban air"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"bdbac282-7dde-3682-aa12-4b51cb854531","name":"Human damage ozone formation","refUnit":"kg NOx-eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"5bb82762-2134-3d49-902b-d9e32a23cc1e","name":"Stratospheric ozone depletion","refUnit":"kg CFC11-eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"18d8ef2b-7e9d-3cd2-bffd-f3aecc3cfd63","name":"Fossil resource scarcity","refUnit":"kg oil-eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"e6d6ede5-e680-300d-b3f5-fe86b8001580","name":"Particulate matter formation","refUnit":"kg PM2.5-eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"318af92c-9e5f-31bb-871a-f32732a911b8","name":"Ionizing radiation","refUnit":"kBq Co-60 to air eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"ef8c26b5-cc0f-3de6-b54b-ae639c6c21fb","name":"Land occupation","refUnit":"m2*a"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"7de564ba-1fbf-3629-9700-6906489d6340","name":"Water consumption","refUnit":"m3"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"dee1d040-360b-3398-a912-6ce9ef4405f9","name":"Terrestrial acidification","refUnit":"kg SO2-eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"652d450f-fc70-329d-8f26-21d67484995c","name":"Human noncarcinogenic toxicity","refUnit":"1,4-DCB eq. emitted to urban air"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"6cd38f2b-5e49-3163-b563-e5eb815d8053","name":"Global Warming","refUnit":"kg CO2eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"2ee9cf1c-8f03-31d6-82d5-83230c75116e","name":"Terrestrial ecotoxicity","refUnit":"1,4-DCB eq. emitted to industrial soil"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"30b60882-63f3-34a8-89ee-fd071759e91f","name":"Ecosyste damage ozone formation","refUnit":"kg NOx-eq"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"660a86a2-984d-3003-a14d-3f085f1f6acc","name":"Freshwater ecotoxicity","refUnit":"1,4-DCB eq. emitted to freshwater"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"6e176c4f-4474-3a8b-9223-dc4fdbd972be","name":"Freshwater eutrophication","refUnit":"kg P-eq. to freshwater"},{"@type":"ImpactCategory","@id":"ae798f03-dd6c-34ad-907f-34780f92f4d7","name":"Mineral resource scarcity","refUnit":"kg Cu-eq"}]}

The initial assessment was completed in June 2013 and included ten representative models from five product families. As subsequent product models have been added to the product families, the corresponding GHG results have been calculated and included in this summary. The GHG Assessment covers the full life cycle - raw materials, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, use, and end of life. The GHG assessment objectives were: \r\n1. Identify the key drivers of GHG emissions from these scanners to provide data that can be used to reduce the life cycle GHG emissions of future versions of these or other\r\nscanner models.\r\n2. Provide average scanner GHG emissions data for customers and formulas that will allow customers to customize results to their specific location and use scenario.\r\n3. Meet the optional IEEE 1680.2 Imaging equipment EPEAT greenhouse gas emissions calculation requirement in 4.5.2.1.

This document provides the overview and refers to specific documents that define the detailed requirements in the five areas quality, method, nomenclature, review, and documentation of LCA data sets. Note that application areas (via archetype goal situations) and data quality levels are differentiated that are to be referenced explicitly when identifying the compliance of a data set. While the document defines all variants, this reference relates to the definition of: \"ILCD Data Network - Entry-level\". Note that the entry-level is below ILCD-compliance and does not imply methodological compliance with the ILCD Handbook.","version":"35.00.000","lastChange":"2011-10-31T21:00:00-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"c6382f8c-e6b0-31ef-83d7-3d8a995b6775","name":"Compliance systems","categoryType":"Source"},"textReference":"European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Institute for Environment and Sustainability (2010): International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) - Data Network - Compliance rules and entry-level requirements.

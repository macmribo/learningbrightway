It does not describe the LCA technique in detail, nor does it specify methodologies for the individual phases of the LCA.\r\n\r\nThe intended application of LCA or LCI results is considered during definition of the goal and scope, but the application itself is outside the scope of this International Standard.","version":"00.00.001","lastChange":"2018-10-01T20:32:32.436-06:00","url":"https://www.iso.org/standard/37456.html","year":2006}

This\r\nincluded the full life cycle - raw materials, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, use, and end of life (EOL). The GHG emissions calculations were based on IPCC 2013 GWP 100a Version 1.02 (100-year timeframe). The primary functional unit of this study was one scanner life, with a secondary functional unit of 1000 A4 scanned images. These two units are inter-convertible when combined with the user scenario described in the Functional Units section of the report.","version":"00.00.002","lastChange":"2021-08-12T15:47:05.309-06:00","url":"https://www.kodakalaris.com/getmedia/cb55ddb9-6b8c-4dab-b77d-0876d047ca63/Life-Cycle-GHG-Assessment-Summary-S3000-Series-Scanners.pdf.aspx","textReference":"Kodak Alaris (2021).

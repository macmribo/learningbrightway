Infrastructure for refueling stations are included in the processes \"E10, pumped into vehicle\" and \"E85, pumped into vehicle.\"  \nThe production of ethanol utilized in this process assigns inputs to co-products (e.g., wheat kernals and straw, corn grain and stover) based on activities and inputs that are required for the growth and harvest and preprocessing of, e.g., wheat straw, and none that of the activities or inputs that would normally be used to produce, harvest and preprocess, e.g., wheat kernals (so-called \"incremental allocation\"). \n","version":"00.00.005","lastChange":"2020-04-13T16:30:06.506-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"0927a450-e2b2-3455-983b-42ff1ebacc3c","name":"3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","categoryPath":["31-33: Manufacturing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"2008","technologyDescription":"modern","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":false,"validFrom":"2007-12-31-07:00","validUntil":"2021-12-31-07:00","creationDate":"2015-09-11T08:42:37.838-06:00","geographyDescription":"North America","dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4abc5016-b922-34c0-a2c1-136c5cfa7083","name":"Garvin Heath"},"dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4abc5016-b922-34c0-a2c1-136c5cfa7083","name":"Garvin Heath"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"a1d1d73e-7d93-3a6b-a3bc-3b2f4f025b86","name":"Hsu, D.

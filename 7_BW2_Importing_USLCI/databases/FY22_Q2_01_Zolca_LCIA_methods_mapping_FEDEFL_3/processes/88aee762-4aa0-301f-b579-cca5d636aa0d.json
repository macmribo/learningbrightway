The study (Main Data Source) underwent external peer review prior to this submission to the US LCI database.                                                                               2.  CARBON SEQUESTRATION should be accounted for after the product is built in its LCA model, and should be included depending on the use of end of life fate of that product.  For example, a soy-based resin may retain the sequestered carbon indefinitely, while a soy-based biodiesel releases the sequestered carbon at use phase.  \nBiomass carbon contents are as follows: \nCRUDE SOY OIL: 77% C --\u003e 2.823 kg CO2/kg crude soy oil; \nSOY MEAL: 48% C --\u003e 1.76 kg CO2/kg meal; \nREFINED SOY OIL: 80.6% C --\u003e 2.955 kg CO2/kg refined soy oil;\nBIODIESEL: 77% C --\u003e 2.823 kg CO2/kg biodiesel.\n3 ALLOCATION: THE VALUES IN THE \"FLOW INFO\" SHEET ARE NOT ALLOCATED, BUT THE DEFAULT ALLOCATION IS ON A PHYSICAL BASIS.

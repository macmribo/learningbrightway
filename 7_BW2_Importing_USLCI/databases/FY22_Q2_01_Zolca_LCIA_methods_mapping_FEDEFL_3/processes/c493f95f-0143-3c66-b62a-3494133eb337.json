The process however omits the production of the metal coils themselves as the feedstock metal can vary depending on the product.  Raw materials include all known pre-treatments, cleaners, paints, and packaging materials to protect the finished sheets--as well as inbound transport.  Manufacturing processes require electricity, heat from natural gas, and process water.  Air and water emissions are captured in the output of the process.","version":"00.02.007","lastChange":"2021-04-07T21:00:13.589-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"3427adf3-d1be-38d0-b599-322dd7d200cb","name":"3328: Coating, Engraving, Heat Treating, and Allied Activities","categoryPath":["31-33: Manufacturing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","technologyDescription":"Metal coil coating process necessary for metallic construction products.

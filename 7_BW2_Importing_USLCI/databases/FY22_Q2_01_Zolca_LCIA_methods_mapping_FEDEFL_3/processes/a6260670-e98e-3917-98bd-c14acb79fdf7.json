Australia, Jamaica, Suriname, and Brazil produce the majority of this alumina. Based on import statistics, 32 percent of alumina imported by the U.S. comes from Australia, 5 percent comes from Jamaica, 13 percent comes from Suriname, and 1 percent comes from Brazil. Primary fuels used for electricity generation in these countries were calculated from worldwide energy data available from the U.S. EIA. Primary fuels used to generate electricity for alumina production facilities in the U.S. are calculated from the fuel mix for the North American Electricity Reliability Council (NERC) regional electricity grid in which the plants are located.\n\nImportant note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has \nundergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet \nundergone a formal validation process.\nPlease email comments to lci@nrel.gov.","version":"00.00.006","lastChange":"2021-04-07T12:36:49.963-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"22b8f169-c337-3c11-98a7-cc688afb99b3","name":"2211: Electric Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution","categoryPath":["22: Utilities"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","technologyDescription":"Coal (36%), Nuclear (5%), Hydropower (14%), Fuel oil (10%), Natural gas (34%)","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":false,"validFrom":"2003-12-31-07:00","validUntil":"2003-12-31-07:00","creationDate":"2013-10-22T09:02:26-06:00","geographyDescription":"US (49%), Australia (32%), Jamaica (5%), Suriname (13%), and Brazil (1%).

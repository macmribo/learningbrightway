The bales must be broken down and the material sorted to remove foreign material. The sorted materials may or may not go through a pre-washing stage before they are granulated to flake. Some amount of  reclaimed resin is received at the facility already in flake form. This flake may be clean or dirty, but all reclaimed flake is washed to market specifications as part of the reclaimer processing operations. This is most often achieved with a caustic wash, but different reclaimers reported using a variety of washing chemicals including surfactants, defoamers, and wetting agents. Clean postconsumer PET is commonly sold in flake form, or it can be pelletized. This unit process includes pelletizing ONLY. Steps for debaling, grinding, washing, drying, and granulating into flake are included in another linked unit process. Some reclaimers extrude the postconsumer PET directly into a staple fiber product. Depending on the level of processing, the postconsumer PET resin may be used for food-grade or non-food applications. ","reviewDetails":"The LCI study was conducted by Franklin Associates, Ltd. and sponsored jointly by NAPCOR, the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers (APR), and the PET Resin Association (PETRA). Using life cycle inventory (LCI) methodology, the study determines and quantifies the energy requirements, solid wastes, and atmospheric and waterborne emissions for the processes required to collect postconsumer PET and HDPE packaging, sort and separate the material, and reprocess it into clean recycled resin. The data has had a partial critical review by internal parties.","dataTreatmentDescription":"For each facility, operating data normalized to basis of 1000 lb output, then individual reclaimer data sets were aggregated, weighting each data set according to the facility’s contribution to the total output of postconsumer recycled HDPE or PET ; Other assumtions and calculations described in Modeling Constants \u0026 Sampling Procedure. ","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional; data sets for the three recycling unit processes (collection, sorting/separation, reclaimer operations) were linked to cover the full sequence of processing steps required to produce recycled resins  gate-to-gate results; for cradle-to-gate LCI of recycled resin, the practitioner needs to make decision about virgin resin burdens associated with the postconsumer products that are feedstocks to recycling. Recycling occurs in the context of a product made from resin; use and end-of-life management of the material will depend on the product in which it is used","modelingConstantsDescription":"Some recycled PET is sold in the form of resin pellets. The additional energy required to convert 1,000 pounds of recycled PET flake to resin pellets is 218 kWh, based on primary data from the reclaimer surveys. No further details can be provided about the data in order to comply with confidentiality agreements with data providers.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\r\nThis unit process includes pelletizing ONLY. Steps for debaling, grinding, washing, drying, and granulating PET into flake are included in another linked unit process. The PET recycling data do not include solid stating to convert the resin to a bottle-ready state. If the recycled resin data are being used in a life cycle inventory for the production of bottles, the practitioner constructing the model may need to add energy for solid stating of the recycled PET resin.\r\n\r\nDATA COLLECTION\r\nData collection forms for HDPE and PET reclaimers were developed for this project by ERG. Completed forms were received from 4 PET facilities and 6 HDPE facilities. The data sets were used to compile a weighted average for each resin based on each facility’s recycled resin output as a percentage of the total output of that recycled resin for all reporting facilities. As with the MRF data sets, only the weighted average data sets can be shown in order to protect the confidentiality of individual facility data sets. Assumptions and calculations are described in Modeling Constants and the supporting documentation.\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION\r\nNo uncertainty estimations were included.","restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

Suspension polymerization utilizes an aqueous system with the monomer in a dispersed phase which results in a dispersed solid phase polymer.  This dispersion is maintained through the use of agitation and water soluble stabilizers.  The product from suspension polymerization is a bead polymer impregnated with a blowing agent.

For EPS resin, no use of resource-intensive or high-toxicity chemicals or additives was identified. Therefore, the results for EPS resin are not expected to be understated by any significant amount due to substances that may be used in small amounts.  Capital equipment, facilities, and infrastructure are not included in this unit process.\r\n\r\n2) TREATMENT OF MISSING DATA TO OR FROM THE ENVIRONMENT \r\nLess than three companies provided data for some atmospheric/waterborne emissions in this dataset.

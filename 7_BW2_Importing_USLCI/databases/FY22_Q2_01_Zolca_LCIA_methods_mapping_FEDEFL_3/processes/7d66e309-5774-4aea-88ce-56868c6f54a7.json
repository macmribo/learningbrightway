The production mix for the United States was calculated using 2014 data from the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA 2015, forms EIA-906. EIA-920 and EIA-923). Data for 2013 from the International Energy Agency (IEA 2016) were used for Mexico, as these were the most recently available. Since electricity imports from Mexico represent less than 1% of the total energy consumed in the U.S., these data are not expected to have a significant effect on the results. 2014 Canadian data were taken from Statistics Canada.","version":"00.00.010","lastChange":"2019-08-13T12:15:17.980-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"22b8f169-c337-3c11-98a7-cc688afb99b3","name":"2211: Electric Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution","categoryPath":["22: Utilities"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","technologyDescription":"Typical","dataCollectionDescription":"2013-2014","completenessDescription":"Data represent all electricity produced in the US + Canadian and Mexican import/exports.","reviewDetails":"The LCA study that produced this unit process was critically reviewed per ISO 14040 and 14044 standards by Dr. Lindita Bushi, Senior Research Associate of Athena Sustainable Materials Institute.","dataTreatmentDescription":"This dataset have been produced by assembling data from different Canadian, US and Mexican governmental agencies.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional","modelingConstantsDescription":"This dataset have been produced by assembling data from different Canadian, US and Mexican governmental agencies.","samplingDescription":"This dataset have been produced by assembling data from different Canadian, US and Mexican governmental agencies.","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":true,"validFrom":"2013-12-31-07:00","validUntil":"2014-12-30-07:00","creationDate":"2012-07-16T06:01:43-06:00","intendedApplication":"In order to respond to increasing interest among product manufacturers and consumer retail markets in selecting more sustainable packaging options, CPA engaged NCASI to update the results of a LCA they published in 2014 that relied primarily on 2010 data to the most recent available data (i.e., 2014 data). This electricity dataset is part of that project. SITUATION A -- MICRO-LEVEL DECISION SUPPORT: The intended application for this process is for micro-level decision support as described in Goal Situation A from the ILCD Handbook\u0027s Detailed Guidance. These data were developed as specific, average or generic unit process LCI results for use in answering internal company product-related questions. A full inventory of environmental flows are included, thus this unit process can be used for a full range of LCIA impact categories, on the fate and transport considerations have been applied. The original study results were analyzed using the TRACI LCIA factors.","projectDescription":"This dataset is part of an LCA project commissioned by the Corrugated Packaging Alliance (CPA), a joint venture of the American Forest \u0026 Paper Association (AF\u0026PA), Fibre Box Association (FBA), the Association of Independent Corrugated Converters (AICC) and TAPPI. For this study, a core project team was established to direct, review, and coordinate the activities associated with the methodologies employed, data collection, modeling, presentation and dissemination of the LCI data and corresponding LCA results. The core group for this project consisted of a technical advisory group within the Fibre Box Association (FBA) Sustainability Committee along with various staff from the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement (NCASI).","geographyDescription":"","reviewer":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"e597518e-863b-326e-bf32-69a1a37635cc","name":"Dr. Lindita Bushi

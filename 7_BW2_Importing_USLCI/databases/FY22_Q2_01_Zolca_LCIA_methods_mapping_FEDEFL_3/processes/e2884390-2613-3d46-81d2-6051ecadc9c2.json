The energy requirements and environmental emissions for the production of styrene including the production of ethylbenzene.  Various coproduct streams are produced during this process. A mass basis was used to partition the credit for these coproducts.  CO2 atmospheric emissions may be overstated by an unknown amount of CO2 from fuel-based emissions included with reported process-based CO2.  Complete inventory data and metadata are available in full in the final report and appendices, Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates and has undergone partial critical review by ACC Plastics Division members and is available at: www.americanchemistry.com. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and and this module due to rounding.  Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.

This batch is sent to a refractory-lined glass furnace to gradually melt the raw materials required into liquid molten form. The molten glass is extruded through bushings, which contain bundles of very small holes, to produce E-Glass fibers with diameters in the 5-25 micron range. These fibers are then coated with a sizing solution. This sizing helps protect the glass fibers for processing. It also ensures proper bonding to the resin matrix. The individual fibers are then bundled together in large numbers to provide a roving.","samplingDescription":"Data are from primary sources. The general grade fiberglass producers who provided data for this module verified that the characteristics of their plants are representative of US E-glass production facilities.

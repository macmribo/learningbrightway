No chemicals with significant individual contribution to any environmental indicator (i.e. \u003e 5%) were ignored. In addition, the mills were asked to report the total mass of \"other fillers\" required to calculate the average carbon content of containerboard. No significant energy input was omitted. Capital equipment and maintenance, maintenance and operation of support equipment, or transport of employees were excluded. In addition, the study did not include energy related to the use of the packaging product, nor that of the product packaged by it. Other overhead functions such as HVAC and lighting were included to the extent they are considered in total mill energy usage as reported by participating companies.\r\nMASS BALANCE: Water, fiber and carbon balances were performed for the containerboard production and converting unit processes. Where adequate, the results of the mass balances were used to correct the collected data.","reviewDetails":"The LCA study that produced this unit process was critically reviewed per ISO 14040 and 14044 standards by Dr. Lindita Bushi, Senior Research Associate of Athena Sustainable Materials Institute.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Primary data were from survey data odetailing production, energy and raw material inputs from 42 containerboard mills representing 70% of overal production volume for 2014. Data on water inputs, environmental loads, solid waste management, and energy (quantity and types of fuels) for the relevant pulp and paper mills were drawn from responses to the 2014 AF\u0026PA Enironmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Survey. Information on quantity of energy used, fiber input, furnish production, and chemical consumption (quantity and type) at the department level were collected in a supplemental survey. Data regarding the emissions of toxic substances (as defined by the U.S. Toxics Release Inventory-TRI) were modeled using U.S. LCI and NCASI information. It was assumed that the mills for which data were collected were spread out geographically in a way that was representative of the average. Data on nutrient content of treated wastewater effluents from pulp and paper mills were derived from available information in the U.S. EPA Permit Compliance System database https://www.epa.gov/enviro/pcs-icis-overview; these data are insufficient to allow characterization of effluents from the specific mills in the database, but they do allow general characterization of effluents from U.S. pulp and paper mills. Data submitted by the industry in connection with the TSCA Inventory Update Rule (IUR, www.epa.gov/iur/) were used to estimate quantities of kraft pulping co-products produced (e.g., tall oil and turpentine); the IUR data were not sufficient to characterize every mill in the database, but were sufficient to characterize kraft pulping processes in general. Information provided via the surveys was quality-assured (QA) using a combination of cross-checking with data previously submitted to the AF\u0026PA EHS survey (which had previously been subjected to a quality-assurance protocol) and by evaluating internal consistency of various data elements based on engineering principles. This process resulted in the inclusion of data for all the 42 containerboard mills. Purchased electricity was assigned upstream loads for the electrical grid serving the specific facilities on which the LCA is based (based on eGrid regions). Containerboard facility location was used to determine the applicable region-specific emission factor. Facility electricity use by product (pro-rated by production mass) was then used to develop the overall electricity mix by product grade, which was different for the industryaverage corrugated products and the product made from 100%-recycled fiber. The load for electricity and steam sold by those facilities was not included in the study. The average quantities of individual fuels consumed during production of steam by the utility CHP plants serving the containerboard mills were estimated using detailed facility information from the 2010 LCA, the US EPA eGRID database, and the Efficiency Method as recommended by the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol. Foreground transportation distances were modeled using the 2012 Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) (U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Department of Commerce, 2015) and the CORRIM database.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional","modelingConstantsDescription":"his process is generated per survey data detailing production, energy and raw material inputs from 42 containerboard mills representing 70% of overal production volume for 2014. Based on the survey data collected directly from the mills, the utilization rate (quantity of recovered fiber used per unit of production) in 2014 was 0.52 kg/kg containerboard produced and used in the U.S. (or 0.58 kg/kg of corrugated product). This resulted in a utilization rate of 0.48 kg/kg total containerboard produced in the U.S. This compares to a value of 0.47 kg/kg containerboard reported by AF\u0026PA (2015). Recovered fiber used in 2014 containerboard production comes from three main sources: converting wastes, post-consumer old corrugated containers and recovery from other product systems.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The system boundary includes: debarking and chipping of wood delivered to mills; on-site virgin pulp production in a high-pressure/temperature digester; on-site recycled pulp production/re-pulping; papermaking and conversion (feeding through headbox and wire section, pressing, pre-drying, size pressing, final drying, and winding); and supporting activities (on-site steam and power production, effluent treatment, on-site residual managment, etc.).\r\nDATA COLLECTION: Primary data were from survey data detailing production, energy and raw material inputs from 42 containerboard mills representing 70% of overal production volume for 2014.

SITUATION A -- MICRO-LEVEL DECISION SUPPORT: The intended application for this process is for micro-level decision support as described in Goal Situation A from the ILCD Handbook\u0027s Detailed Guidance. These data were developed as specific, average or generic unit process LCI results for use in answering internal company product-related questions.

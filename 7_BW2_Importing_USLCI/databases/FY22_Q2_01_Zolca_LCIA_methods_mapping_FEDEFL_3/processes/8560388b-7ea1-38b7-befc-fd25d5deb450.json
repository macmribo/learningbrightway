The proportions of these raw materials can vary greatly, depending upon the steel grade and other factors. \nInitially, the raw materials are melted in an electric arc furnace (EAF); the liquid metal is then transferred to a decarburising vessel (usually \"argon oxygen decarburising\", AOD) where it is refined by blowing with various mixes of argon, oxygen, nitrogen. The liquid steel is then finished in a ladle furnace (LF), where the chemistry is fine-tuned and the temperature is optimised for subsequent processing. \nThe liquid steel is transformed into a solid product by continuous casting. For flat product production the section is rectangular, known as \"slab\". \nSlabs are converted into rectangular (quarto) plates or long coils by reheating and hot-rolling. Subsequent heat treatment (annealing), acid cleaning (pickling) and flattening produces finished quarto plate or white hot rolled coil products. \nAlternatively, the white hot rolled coil is used as the feedstock for producing thinner coil products, by cold rolling. The white hot rolled coil is cold rolled; then it is softened \u0026 acid pickled or bright annealed, and flattened (skinpass rolled) to form the Cold Rolled Coil product. \n \nNOTE: this dataset considers American upstreams condition and applies assumption that European and American technology on stainless steel production are similar","reviewDetails":"For details please contact the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries, Eurofer (European data): www.eurofer.org.

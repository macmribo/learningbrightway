Reformate feedstock rich in xylenes is fractionated to obtain a stream rich in the para-isomer. The ortho isomer is first separated off by distillation. A crystallization unit is then used to separate the meta and para isomers using adsorption of the paraxylene isomer on a molecular sieve adsorbent. The paraxylene isomer is collected on the adsorbent while the metaxylene passes through the adsorbent bed and is collected. The paraxylene is then stripped of the adsorbent using diethylbenzene isomers. The meta and para isomers can also be separated using crystallization and then centrifuged for purification. LCI data for the production of Paraxylene (PX) was collected from three producers (3 plants) in North America – all in the United States. Not all plants were able to provide data for 2015. One plant provided 2013 data and one provided 2016 data. These variances were due to plant issues (e.g. shut downs/updates/temporary maintenance shut downs) during 2015 that may have skewed the average. Coproducts include a number of aromatics, carbon dioxide, and some fuels. For the coproducts sold for material use in other processes, mass basis was used to allocate the credit for the coproduct. For coproducts sold for fuel use in other processes, these were treated as an avoided fuel product and were given credits based on the fuel they would replace. The average paraxylene datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each paraxylene data provider.","version":"00.00.034","lastChange":"2021-01-07T17:19:51.172-07:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"01fd1e94-45bd-3239-8d50-7d7488c1cac4","name":"3241: Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing","categoryPath":["31-33: Manufacturing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"","technologyDescription":"Paraxylene production at plant, US","dataCollectionDescription":"Not all plants were able to provide data for 2015.

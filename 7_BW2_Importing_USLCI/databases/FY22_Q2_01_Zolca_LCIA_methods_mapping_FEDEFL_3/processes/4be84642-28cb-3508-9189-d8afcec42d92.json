(Directly from TEAM). The corn steep liquor production involves the steeping of harvested corn for a period of from 24 to 48 hours in a light sulfurous acid solution. The production of sulfurous acid was assumed to be negligible. The only emissions were SOx from the steeping tanks. Emission factors provided by USA EPA AP-42.  All of the production burdens from corn are assumed to be allocated to the production of the steeping liquor.","version":"00.00.008","lastChange":"2021-04-07T18:45:10.407-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"1a059a45-a303-383c-acf9-9b6e1192eecc","name":"1151: Support Activities for Crop Production","categoryPath":["11: Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"2010","technologyDescription":"modern","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":false,"validFrom":"2009-12-31-07:00","validUntil":"2021-12-31-07:00","creationDate":"2015-08-13T13:49:02.717-06:00","geographyDescription":"North America","dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"04ed125f-ffa7-33b1-af24-77f5bdb21a05","name":"Daniel Inman"},"dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"04ed125f-ffa7-33b1-af24-77f5bdb21a05","name":"Daniel Inman"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"a1d1d73e-7d93-3a6b-a3bc-3b2f4f025b86","name":"Hsu, D.

Capital equipment used for manufacturing were not included.  \r\nNote that there were no significant emissions to air, soil, or water from the scanner assembly process.  No emissions were measured and estimnates could not be quantified, but were believed to be were well 0.1% of total emissions from the full cradle to gate process, so zero emissions were included.\r\nMass Balance - The mass of inputs (not including fuels) balances with the scanner output, so there is less than 1% difference.","dataSelectionDescription":"An attempt was made to include data for all inputs.

The Wood (2021) methodology is almost identical to the methodology described in Wood (2012) which is an ISO 14044 compliant, peer-reviewed LCA report of three Kodak scanners (Kodak i2800; i2600; and i2400), which was peer reviewed by Kate Wennebeck of Rochester Institute of Technology\u0027s Pollution Prevention Institute.  A third party review of the current LCA by the New York State Pollution Prevention Institute is in progress and results will be included in a later update to this data.","dataTreatmentDescription":"Primary data were taken from precise engineering specifications specific to this unit process.  These data were then transformed into material and energy flows using the methodology described in Wood (2022) which is due to be released in July, 2022.  The Wood (2022) methodology, which is an ISO 14044 compliant LCA, was independent third party reviewed. \r\n\r\nSecondary data were taken from the ecoinvent 3.2 database (Wernet et al. 2016) and the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2016).

Other inputs (e.g. energy; waste transport and disposal) were calculated on the basis of quantity of input per kg of scanner produced.\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION\r\nUncertainty was estimated based on engineering judgment.  Material inputs had less uncertainty because they were based off of precise engineering specifications.  Other inputs  (e.g. energy; waste transport and disposal) had more uncertainty.

The calculation of the \"value of scrap\" is based on the difference in LCI of the 100% primary and 100% scrap route (theoretical calculation) under consideration of the process yield of the recycling step. \nThe \"value of scrap\" (\u003d stainless steel scrap LCI) is then used to account for a potential net surplus or debit of stainless steel along the life cycle of a stainless steel product.","version":"00.00.023","lastChange":"2021-01-22T02:09:12.457-07:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"57846605-6f13-3fe1-ac41-aa892774d8ed","name":"3311: Iron and Steel Mills and Ferroalloy Manufacturing","categoryPath":["31-33: Manufacturing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"56bca136-90bb-3a77-9abb-7ce558af711e","name":"Global"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"Annual average, site-specific data for one year.","technologyDescription":"The \"value of scrap\" is calculated on the basis of the stainless steel product cradle-to-gate LCIs. \nThese underlying datasets cover the following technology and background system: \nStainless steels are manufactured from mixtures of stainless scrap, carbon steel scrap and ferro-alloys of Cr, Ni and Mo. The proportions of these raw materials can vary greatly, depending upon the steel grade and other factors. \nInitially, the raw materials are melted in an electric arc furnace (EAF); the liquid metal is then transferred to a decarburising vessel (usually \"argon oxygen decarburising\", AOD) where it is refined by blowing with various mixes of argon, oxygen, nitrogen. The liquid steel is then finished in a ladle furnace (LF), where the chemistry is fine-tuned and the temperature is optimised for subsequent processing. \nThe liquid steel is transformed into a solid product by continuous casting. For flat product production the section is rectangular, known as \"slab\". \nSlabs are converted into rectangular (quarto) plates or long coils by reheating and hot-rolling. Subsequent heat treatment (annealing), acid cleaning (pickling) and flattening produces finished quarto plate or white hot rolled coil products. \nAlternatively, the white hot rolled coil is used as the feedstock for producing thinner coil products, by cold rolling. The white hot rolled coil is cold rolled; then it is softened \u0026 acid pickled or bright annealed, and flattened (skinpass rolled) to form the Cold Rolled Coil product.","reviewDetails":"For details please contact the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries, Eurofer (European data): www.eurofer.org.

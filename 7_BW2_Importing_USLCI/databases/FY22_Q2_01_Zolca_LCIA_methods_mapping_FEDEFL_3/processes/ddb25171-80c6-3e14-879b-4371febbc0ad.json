An average of 0.011 kg of rigid composite part scrap is produced for every kilogram of open molded parts produced; this scrap is sold for recycling. The packaging inputs in this data set represent the average reported per kilogram of output across a range of products produced at manufacturing facilities. Possible differences in the mass balance include ancillary materials, incoming packaging (including wood), and other unspecified process wastes that are thrown out but not accounted for as inputs in the LCI.  Complete inventory data and metadata are shown in full in the final report, Life Cycle Inventory of Polymer Composites. The report is not publicly available. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates by Rebe Feraldi, Anne Marie Molen, and Melissa Huff and has undergone partial critical review by ACMA members. Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.

The initial raw material is bauxite ore and final product is primary aluminum ingot with intermediate products of alumina (aluminum oxide) and molten aluminum (liquid) metal.\n\nBackground system: Addressed below (electricity and energy)\n\nElectricity: Electricity is modelled according to the individual country-specific situations. The country-specific modelling is achieved on multiple levels. Firstly, individual energy carrier specific power plants and plants for renewable energy sources are modelled according to the current national electricity grid mix. Modelling the electricity consumption mix includes transmission / distribution losses and the own use by energy producers (own consumption of power plants and \"other\" own consumption e.g. due to pumped storage hydro power etc.), as well as imported electricity. Secondly, the national emission and efficiency standards of the power plants are modelled as well as the share of electricity plants and combined heat and power plants (CHP). Thirdly, the country-specific energy carrier supply (share of imports and / or domestic supply) including the country-specific energy carrier properties (e.g. element and energy content) are accounted for. Fourthly, the exploration, mining/production, processing and transport processes of the energy carrier supply chains are modelled according to the specific situation of each electricity producing country. The different production and processing techniques (emissions and efficiencies) in the different energy producing countries are considered, e.g. different crude oil production technologies or different flaring rates at the oil platforms.\n\nThermal energy, process steam: The thermal energy and process steam supply is modelled according to the individual country-specific situation with regard to emission standards and considered energy carriers. The thermal energy and process steam are produced at heat plants. Efficiencies for thermal energy production are by definition 100% in relation to the corresponding energy carrier input. For process steam the efficiency ranges from 85%, 90% to 95%. The energy carriers used for the generation of thermal energy and process steam are modelled according to the specific import situation (see electricity above).\n\nTransports: All relevant and known transport processes are included. Ocean-going and inland ship transport as well as rail, truck and pipeline transport of bulk commodities are considered.\n\nEnergy carriers: The energy carriers are modelled according to the specific supply situation (see electricity above).\n\nRefinery products: Diesel fuel, gasoline, technical gases, fuel oils, lubricants and residues such as bitumen are modelled with a parameterised country-specific refinery model. The refinery model represents the current national standard in refining techniques (e.g. emission level, internal energy consumption, etc.) as well as the individual country-specific product output spectrum, which can be quite different from country to country. The supply of crude oil is modelled, again, according to the country-specific situation with the respective properties of the resources.","reviewDetails":"All data sets in the GaBi Databases are constantly used, compared, benchmarked and reviewed by a broad GaBi user community. Calculated results are published frequently in various external, professional and third party LCA literature, papers, and other media within industry, academia and politics. The incorporation of feedback provided by the GaBi users is standard practice in the maintenance and update procedure, and leads to stable, quality-assured and constantly improved data.  The internal review is done with several iterative steps involving raw data validation, raw data documentation, representativeness, completeness and consistent modelling with regard to ISO 14040 and 14044. The data set documentation is correct in respect to the appropriateness of the information available. It includes all relevant information in relation to data quality and the scope of application of the respective LCI result. Dept. of Life Cycle Engineering (GaBi), LBP (Chair for Building Physics), Universitaet Stuttgart; Review of the report was carried out by UL Environment as part of the EPD verification process, Tom Gloria of Industrial Ecology Consultants provided the expert review.","samplingDescription":"Survey of randomly selected manufacturers in the Aluminum Association\u0027s database.

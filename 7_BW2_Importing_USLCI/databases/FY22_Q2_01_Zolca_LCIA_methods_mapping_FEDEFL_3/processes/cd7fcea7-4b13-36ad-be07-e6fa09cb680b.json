Consumers would drop off bottles as an incidental stop on a trip with some other primary purpose (e.g., deposit bottles purchased at a grocery store would be returned on the next trip to the store to buy groceries), so fuel use for returning deposit containers is treated as incidental, with no consumer transport burdens assigned to returning deposit containers. Accumulated quantities of deposit containers are modeled as being transported from the collection point to an intermediate processing center (IPC).

Recycling occurs in the context of a product made from resin; use and end-of-life management of the material will depend on the product in which it is used","modelingConstantsDescription":"Based on information provided by a confidential source, transport of deposit containers to the IPC is modeled as a volume-limited load of loose bottles transported by a single-unit truck. The distance is estimated as 20 miles, and a fuel economy of 8.2 mpg is used for the truck from http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/excel/table_04_13.xls.

The 2014 U.S.-average corrugated product studied in this LCA consists of 66.8% linerboard and 33.2% corrugated medium. The average basis weight of the U.S. industry mix is 131.6 lb/thousand square feet (msf, 0.643 kg/m2) and consists of approximately 0.6% singleface, 90.9% singlewall, 8.0% doublewall, and 0.5% triplewall. Surveys requesting detailed production, energy and raw material input, and environmental releases (including material outputs recycled by other facilities) were received from 269 converting facilities. The information provided via the surveys was quality-assured by evaluating internal consistency of various survey data elements based on engineering principles and by comparing with average or median values reported by similar facilities. A mass balance was performed considering all input materials and outputs of corrugated sheets, finished corrugated products, recycled materials, and solid waste. Agreement of inputs and outputs within 10% was required for a facilityâ€™s survey information to be included in the analysis. The carbon contents of corrugated products were calculated using carbon balances. Energy consumption data entry elements underwent a two-step QA process: 1) comparing entries to those of similar facilities to identify gross errors, and 2) identification of potential outliers using statistical outlier tests of total energy intensity. Entered values of material inputs and water contents of those inputs were evaluated for reasonableness. Entered values for water intake to facilities were compared with those of water releases for that facility. For electricity purchased by converting mills, a 2014 U.S. average power mix was used because the survey representativeness was low and because facilities are spread out across the nation.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional","modelingConstantsDescription":"his process is generated per survey data on energy and material inputs, production, and environmental releases from 166 converting facilities (128 corrugator plants, 31 sheet plants, and 7 sheet-feeder plants) representing 23% of overal production volume for 2014.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The system boundary includes: 1) transport of raw materials to converting facilities; 2) the conversion of rolls of linerboard and corrugating medium to corrugated product by softening with heat/steam, running through corrugated rollers, applying starch to flute tips for glueing to linerboard layer(s), drying in a hot plate section, slitting into sheets, and then stacking, and palletizing for shipping. Emissions are calculated from reported annual averages.\r\nDATA COLLECTION: All material and energy inputs, production processes, and environmental releases are based on a survey including results from 122 corrugator plants, 38 sheet plants, and 13 sheet-feeder plants (a total of 166 converting facilities).

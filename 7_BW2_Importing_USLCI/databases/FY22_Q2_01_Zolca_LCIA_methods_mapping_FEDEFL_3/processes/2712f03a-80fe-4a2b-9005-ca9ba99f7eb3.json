Only the gas-phase and slurry loop reactors were stated as the representative technology by the data providers. Normally a combination of Phillips, Ziegler-Natta and/or metallocene catalysts are required during the process. The metal mining and processing for titanium (ZN catalyst) and chromium and silica gel used in the Phillips catalyst were included.

A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. For this process the data sets are based on actual plant data reported by plant personnel. Supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent.\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Primary data collected from actual facilities are considered the best available data for representing industry operations. In this study, primary data were used to model the HDPE production. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.\r\n\r\n","restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

Polypropylene is manufactured by the polymerization of propylene using Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Commercial processes generally use titanium trichloride in combination with aluminum diethylmonochloride. Production processes vary and include slurry, gas-phase, and solution monomer polymerization. The latter two processes employ the use of improved high-yield catalysts. The five polypropylene datasets represent the gas-phase and solution monomer polymerization processes.","version":"00.00.150","lastChange":"2021-01-08T01:07:03.047-07:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"63e51183-8b22-32b1-957d-42de42ae20bf","name":"3252: Resin, Synthetic Rubber, and Artificial and Synthetic Fibers and Filaments Manufacturing","categoryPath":["31-33: Manufacturing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"For the PP resin primary data, companies were requested to provide data for the year 2015, the most recent full year of PP resin production prior to the project initiation date.

All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data sets were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset.

Small amounts (less than 1 percent of total output) of off-spec/scrap resin and isomers are produced as coproducts during this process and sold. A mass basis was used to allocate out the credit for the coproduct off-spec/scrap resin; thus, this inventory represents only the primary (i.e., virgin resin) produced.

A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. For this process the data sets are based on actual plant data reported by plant personnel. Supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent.\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Primary data collected from actual facilities are considered the best available data for representing industry operations. In this study, primary data were used to model the PP production. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.\r\n\r\n","restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

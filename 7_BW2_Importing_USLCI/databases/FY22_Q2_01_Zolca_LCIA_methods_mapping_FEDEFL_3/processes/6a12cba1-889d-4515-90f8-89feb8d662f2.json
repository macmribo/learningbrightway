The LDPE resin is commonly polymerized in high pressure reactors. This is the standard technology for LDPE resin production. The two reactor types used are autoclaves and tubular reactors. Generally, tubular reactors operate at a higher average ethylene conversion than autoclave reactors. The polymerization mechanism is either free-radical, using peroxide initiators, or ionic polymerization, using Ziegler catalyst. All data providers used the high pressure technology and either the tubular or autoclave reactors with either peroxide initiators or a Ziegler catalyst.

All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data sets were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset. ","dataSelectionDescription":"All LDPE production data was sourced from primary producers.","reviewDetails":"Some ACC members reviewed the data and associated report. Internal review of data entry proofreading, mass balance verification and data documentation was also carried out.","dataTreatmentDescription":"A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. Small amounts (less than 1 percent of total output) of off-spec/scrap resin and isomers are produced as coproducts during this process and sold. A mass basis was used to allocate out the credit for the coproduct off-spec/scrap resin; thus, this inventory represents only the primary (i.e., virgin resin) produced. The average LDPE datasets were reviewed and accepted respectively by each LDPE data provider.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional; Compatible with TRACI","modelingConstantsDescription":"LCI data for the production of LDPE resin were collected from four producers (six plants) in North America – all in the United States. Two companies provided data for the year 2015, and two companies provided data for the year 2016. After reviewing individual company data in comparison to the average, each manufacturer verified data from 2015-2016 was representative of an average year for LDPE resin production at their company. Mass allocation was used to allocate all inputs and outputs to each product and co-products. For steam used in other processes, this was treated as an avoided fuel product and were given credits based on the fuel required to create the steam that it would replace.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The system boundary includes (1) raw material extraction (2) ) intermediate material processing, including incoming transportation for each process LDPE production, and (3) manufacturing of LDPE, including incoming transportation for each material.\r\nDATA COLLECTION: The primary data for the life cycle inventory of the production of LDPE, were collected from four producers (six plants) located in the United States in 2015-2016. A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. For this process the data sets are based on actual plant data reported by plant personnel. Supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent.\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Primary data collected from actual facilities are considered the best available data for representing industry operations. In this study, primary data were used to model the LDPE production. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.\r\n\r\n","restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

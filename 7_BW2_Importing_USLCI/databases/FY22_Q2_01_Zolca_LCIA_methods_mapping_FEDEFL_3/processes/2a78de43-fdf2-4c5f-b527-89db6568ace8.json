The production process is generally close to the process unit for ethylene oxide. In this case, crude oxide solution is used as feed to the glycol unit. Using crude solution avoids a refining step but still provides an adequate feed. An excess amount of water is added to the reactor feed to reduce the amount of diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol. These glycols are produced from the reaction of monoethylene glycol with ethylene oxide. The hydration reaction can be uncatalyzed or catalyzed with an acid. An uncatalyzed reaction is much slower, but acid removal from the glycol is required if a catalyst is used. This glycol/water mixture is sent through an evaporator to concentrate the solution and recover the water. The water is recycled back to be used to prepare the ethylene oxide feed. High purity ethylene glycol is obtained from the concentrated glycol solution by vacuum distillation.","version":"00.00.046","lastChange":"2022-09-14T10:22:17.130-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"0927a450-e2b2-3455-983b-42ff1ebacc3c","name":"3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","categoryPath":["31-33: Manufacturing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":true,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"Reflects conditions in 2015","technologyDescription":"Production of Ethylene glycol at plant (including Ethylene Oxide). \r\n","dataCollectionDescription":"All companies provided data for the years 2015 and 2016 ","completenessDescription":"TREATMENT OF MISSING ENVIRONMENTAL DATA: Elementary flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance.\r\nTREATMENT OF MISSING TECHNOSPHERE DATA: Intermediate flows are cut-off is at 1%  based on environmental relevance.\r\nMASS BALANCE: For primary data the mass balance was calculated by a straight comparison of inputs and outputs","dataSelectionDescription":"Data was collected from three leading ethylene glycol producers (7 plants).

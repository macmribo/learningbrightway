It was built from the process named \"Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), combusted in industrial boiler\" v.1.6 available in the US LCI database. Transport and waste processes were removed. The following emissions to air were excluded (excl.): Sulfur oxidesand Nitrogen oxides. These processes and emissions are reported in pulp and paper mill process chain in which this process is integrated.\nImportant note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has \nundergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet \nundergone a formal validation process.\nPlease email comments to lci@nrel.gov.","version":"00.00.003","lastChange":"2020-04-16T21:49:26.288-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"cbcdb90f-432a-3a1b-a8ec-b2b8f369021d","name":"3221: Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard Mills","categoryPath":["31-33: Manufacturing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","technologyDescription":"LPG combustion in average industrial boiler.","reviewDetails":"unknown","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":false,"validFrom":"2000-12-31-07:00","validUntil":"2000-12-31-07:00","creationDate":"2014-08-25T07:08:05-06:00","geographyDescription":"United States","reviewer":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"c71c2be4-29ec-3a4c-80a6-77242fa644f1","name":"Martha Stevenson"},"dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"bf3f36bd-8fbb-33a7-8317-3a366007dd91","name":"Chantal Lavigne"},"dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"0d6cba77-2eff-3519-92d7-8a87dab88049","name":"Caroline Gaudreault"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"63fd4835-8dbb-3860-8b95-e141e8d5967b","name":"Franklin Associates (2003) LPG Industrial Combustion"},"sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"e6f7d676-1804-3acf-b7e8-82cf84db3281","name":"AF\u0026PA (2010).

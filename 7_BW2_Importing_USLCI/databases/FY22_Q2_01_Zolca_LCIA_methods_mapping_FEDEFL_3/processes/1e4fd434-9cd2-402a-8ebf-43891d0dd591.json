For the 2010 LCA, detailed information pertaining to the fuels consumed and operating characteristics of five of the utility CHP systems providing steam to the containerboard mills were obtained from the US EPAâ€™s eGRID database, pertaining to 2009 (2010 data were not yet available from eGRID; it was not possible to definitively identify the utilities supplying steam to two of the containerboard mills). It was assumed that the five utilities for which data were available were representative of the seven. From this information, the fraction of each fuel making up the total fuel input to the five utility CHP systems and the fraction of the total (considering all five utilities) utility fuel input energy that is allocated to the CHP-produced steam (remainder of fuel energy allocated to produced electricity) were calculated using the Efficiency Method as recommended by the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol (WRI and WBCSD). 2006). In this manner, the average quantities of individual fuels consumed during production of steam by the utility CHP plants serving the containerboard mills were estimated (1.24 MJ HHV/MJ sold steam). It was assumed that that steam mix also applies to the 100%-recycled product. For the 2014 LCA, fuel mixes from the most recent eGrid database were checked and compared to that used for the 2010 data. Because the fuel mix was almost identical, the data used in 2010 were also used for the 2014 LCA.\r\n","samplingDescription":"Evaluation of e-grid data for containerboard mills that purchase steam.","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":false,"validFrom":"2008-12-31-07:00","validUntil":"2009-12-30-07:00","creationDate":"2015-08-06T11:07:44.220-06:00","intendedApplication":"In order to respond to increasing interest among product manufacturers and consumer retail markets in selecting more sustainable packaging options, CPA engaged NCASI to update the results of a LCA they published in 2014 that relied primarily on 2010 data to the most recent available data (i.e., 2014 data). SITUATION A -- MICRO-LEVEL DECISION SUPPORT: The intended application for this process is for micro-level decision support as described in Goal Situation A from the ILCD Handbook\u0027s Detailed Guidance. These data were developed as specific, average or generic unit process LCI results for use in answering internal company product-related questions. A full inventory of environmental flows are included, thus this unit process can be used for a full range of LCIA impact categories, on the fate and transport considerations have been applied. The original study results were analyzed using the TRACI LCIA factors.","projectDescription":"This LCA was commissioned by the Corrugated Packaging Alliance (CPA), a joint venture of the American Forest \u0026 Paper Association (AF\u0026PA), Fibre Box Association (FBA), the Association of Independent Corrugated Converters (AICC) and TAPPI. For this study, a core project team was established to direct, review, and coordinate the activities associated with the methodologies employed, data collection, modeling, presentation and dissemination of the LCI data and corresponding LCA results. The core group for this project consisted of a technical advisory group within the Fibre Box Association (FBA) Sustainability Committee along with various staff from the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement (NCASI).","geographyDescription":"","dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"dd108a6d-7d70-3aa5-a864-34e6850e46d7","name":"Caroline Gaudreault"},"dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"dd108a6d-7d70-3aa5-a864-34e6850e46d7","name":"Caroline Gaudreault"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"3f572a02-a88d-4a6e-a6cf-e06f4bcbf8e3","name":"NCASI (2017) LCA Average Corrugated Product"},"sources":[{"@type":"Source","@id":"3f572a02-a88d-4a6e-a6cf-e06f4bcbf8e3","name":"NCASI (2017) LCA Average Corrugated Product"}]},"lastInternalId":0,"exchanges":[{"@type":"Exchange","avoidedProduct":false,"input":false,"amount":1.0,"internalId":1,"flow":{"@type":"Flow","@id":"caca451d-e5df-4bf4-91f8-2c4be75af6dc","name":"Steam, purchased by containerboard mills","categoryPath":["Technosphere Flows","22: Utilities","2213: Water, Sewage and Other Systems"],"flowType":"PRODUCT_FLOW","refUnit":"MJ"},"unit":{"@type":"Unit","@id":"52765a6c-3896-43c2-b2f4-c679acf13efe","name":"MJ"},"flowProperty":{"@type":"FlowProperty","@id":"f6811440-ee37-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66","name":"Energy","categoryPath":["Technical flow properties"]},"quantitativeReference":true},{"@type":"Exchange","avoidedProduct":false,"input":true,"amount":0.0274,"description":"1.24 MJ HHV per MJ of sold energy.

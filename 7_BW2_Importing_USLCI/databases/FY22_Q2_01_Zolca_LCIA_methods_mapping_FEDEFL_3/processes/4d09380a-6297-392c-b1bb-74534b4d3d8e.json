Includes all crop production processes from field preperation to harvest. Infrastructure, maintenance, and construction of faciilities and equipment is included. Loading/unloading,transport, and storage of material is not included. Grain and components are assumed to be at field-dry conditions of 15.5% moisture. \n\nThe stover process has been seperated from corn to allow for incremental allocation. Only processes directly attributed to stover collection are counted. These processes include additional harvesting energy for single pass harvest, additional nutrients, and hay substitition for loss of potential over-winter cattle feed.\n\nProcess has been reviewed by Dr. Dwayne Westfall, Dept Soil and Crop Sciences, Colorado State University. Date of review Sept 10 - 30 2008.                                                                                                             Data from NASS where available. Extrapolation of existing data to 2022 estimates.  Mass based between stover and grain.","version":"00.00.003","lastChange":"2021-01-22T10:20:59.950-07:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"8db244f2-0fd6-368c-b310-ff167ea058fb","name":"1111: Oilseed and Grain Farming","categoryPath":["11: Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"2010 and after","technologyDescription":"modern","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":false,"validFrom":"2009-12-31-07:00","validUntil":"2100-12-30-07:00","creationDate":"2013-10-22T09:01:20-06:00","geographyDescription":"North America","dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"04ed125f-ffa7-33b1-af24-77f5bdb21a05","name":"Daniel Inman"},"dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"04ed125f-ffa7-33b1-af24-77f5bdb21a05","name":"Daniel Inman"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"a1d1d73e-7d93-3a6b-a3bc-3b2f4f025b86","name":"Hsu, D.

Conventional onshore natural gas is recovered by vertical drilling techniques. Once a conventional onshore gas well has been discovered, the natural gas reservoir does not require significant preparation or stimulation for natural gas recovery. Approximately 63 percent of U.S. natural gas production is from conventional onshore gas wells (US EIA, 2009). The conventional onshore gas wells of this analysis are assumed to have a daily production rate between 400 and 1,550 thousand cubic feet, which is characteristic of approximately 40 percent of gas wells in the U.S. (US EIA, 2009b).

The inputs to this unit process are natural gas, ground water, and surface water. These three inputs are natural resources and thus enter the boundary of this unit process with no upstream environmental burdens. If the natural gas extraction site is near a source of electricity, it is financially preferable to use electrically-powered equipment instead of gas-powered equipment. The output of this unit process is dehydrated natural gas that is suitable for pipeline transport and subsequent processing steps such as sweetening or, in the case of imported natural gas, liquefaction. This unit process also accounts for environmental emissions to air and water but does not track wastewater. ","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The system boundary includes (1) natural gas extraction (2) energy inputs for the process, and (3) water inputs for the process.\r\nDATA COLLECTION: A weighted average was calculated from the data collected for 6 extraction methods and used to develop the composite natural gas extraction process. \r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: All data were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.\r\n","restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

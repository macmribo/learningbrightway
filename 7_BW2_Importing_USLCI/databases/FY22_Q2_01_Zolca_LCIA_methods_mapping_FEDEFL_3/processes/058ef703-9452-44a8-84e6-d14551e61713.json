Compatible with TRACI","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The scope of this unit process encompasses the energy inputs and material outputs for the extraction of natural gas. The inputs to this unit process are natural gas, ground water, and surface water. These three inputs are natural resources and thus enter the boundary of this unit process with no upstream environmental burdens. The output of this unit process is dehydrated natural gas that is suitable for pipeline transport and subsequent processing steps. In addition to resource inputs and outputs that are used by downstream unit processes, this unit process also accounts for environmental emissions to air and water but does not track wastewater. \r\nDATA COLLECTION: NETL LCA Unit Process Library, Natural gas extraction processes 2010.\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from NETL.","restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

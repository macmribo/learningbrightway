The LCI study was conducted by Franklin Associates, Ltd. and sponsored jointly by NAPCOR, the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers (APR), and the PET Resin Association (PETRA). Using life cycle inventory (LCI) methodology, the study determines and quantifies the energy requirements, solid wastes, and atmospheric and waterborne emissions for the processes required to collect postconsumer PET and HDPE packaging, sort and separate the material, and reprocess it into clean recycled resin.\r\n\r\nImportant note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.

For this scenario, transport of bottles from the site to an IPC or to a material recovery facility (MRF) is also based on a volume-limited shipment of loose bottles; however, it is assumed that the accumulated quantities transported per pickup are larger so that a tractor-trailer truck is used , with a fuel economy of 6.5 mpg.","reviewDetails":"The LCI study was conducted by Franklin Associates, Ltd. and sponsored jointly by NAPCOR, the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers (APR), and the PET Resin Association (PETRA).

Recycling occurs in the context of a product made from resin; use and end-of-life management of the material will depend on the product in which it is used","modelingConstantsDescription":"Based on information provided by a confidential source, transport of deposit containers to the IPC is modeled as a volume-limited load of loose bottles transported by a tractor-trailer truck. The distance is estimated as 150 miles, and a fuel economy of 6.5 mpg is used for the truck from http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/excel/table_04_14.xls.  At the IPC or MRF some additional sorting may be done before the resin is baled for shipment to the next processing location.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\r\nThe system boundary includes the commercial transport of accumulated quantities of containers recovered for recycling through a collection program from collection point to an intermediate processing center (IPC) and baling of the containers at the IPC for shipment to the next processing location.\r\n\r\nDATA COLLECTION\r\nAssumptions and calculations are described in Modeling Constants and the supporting documentation.\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION\r\nNo uncertainty estimations were included.","restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

Capital equipment is not included in this unit process.\r\n\r\nMASS BALANCE\r\nMixed recyclables and deposit container inputs include the weight of contaminants in incoming material from MRF. Sodium hydroxide inputs are the pure weight of NaOH for the solution used. Water inputs are to washing and the outputs are the water returned after washing (reflects evaporative losses of water carried out with washed resin and evaporated during drying). It is unknown how much of the waterborne emissions are from washing chemicals versus material washed off received plastic. These emissions are not included in the material balance. Waste disposal weight includes bale wire trash, labels, PVC in incoming bale, and other materials that become processing wastes or sludges.","dataSelectionDescription":"Incoming bales are broken down and the material sorted to remove foreign material. A small amount of reclaimed resin was reported as received already in flake form (weighted average less than 3%). Material may be washed before grinding, after grinding, or both. Most reclaimers reported using a variety of chemicals in the washing process, although types and quantities varied by reclaimer. Incoming HDPE material contains small amounts of non-HDPE saleable material as well as unusable contaminants. The weighted average percentage of non-HDPE saleable material recovered from incoming bales was less than 1%, while 17% of the incoming material was unusable contaminants.","reviewDetails":"The LCI study was conducted by Franklin Associates, Ltd. and sponsored jointly by NAPCOR, the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers (APR), and the PET Resin Association (PETRA). Using life cycle inventory (LCI) methodology, the study determines and quantifies the energy requirements, solid wastes, and atmospheric and waterborne emissions for the processes required to collect postconsumer PET and HDPE packaging, sort and separate the material, and reprocess it into clean recycled resin. The data has had a partial critical review by internal parties.","dataTreatmentDescription":"For each facility, operating data normalized to basis of 1000 lb output, then individual reclaimer data sets were aggregated, weighting each data set according to the facility’s contribution to the total output of postconsumer recycled HDPE or PET ; Other assumtions and calculations described in Modeling Constants \u0026 Sampling Procedure. ","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional; data sets for the three recycling unit processes (collection, sorting/separation, reclaimer operations) were linked to cover the full sequence of processing steps required to produce recycled resins  gate-to-gate results; for cradle-to-gate LCI of recycled resin, the practitioner needs to make decision about virgin resin burdens associated with the postconsumer products that are feedstocks to recycling. Recycling occurs in the context of a product made from resin; use and end-of-life management of the material will depend on the product in which it is used\r\n\r\n","modelingConstantsDescription":"HDPE reclaimers providing data for this analysis produced 448 million pounds of clean flake and converted 427 million pounds of flake to pellet. The weighted average incoming transport profile of postconsumer material was 350 miles by truck and 134 miles by rail. A small amount of ocean transport was also reported. Approximately 92% of incoming material was shipped to participating reclaimers from MRFs, 6% from deposit centers, and less than 1% each from PRFs and other sources. The majority of the incoming material was reported as bottles (82%), with the remainder rigids.","samplingDescription":"BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\r\nProcessing steps include debaling, grinding, washing, drying, extruding and pelletizing. \r\n\r\nDATA COLLECTION\r\nData collection forms for HDPE and PET reclaimers were developed for this project by ERG. Completed forms were received from 4 PET facilities and 6 HDPE facilities. The data sets were used to compile a weighted average for each resin based on each facility’s recycled resin output as a percentage of the total output of that recycled resin for all reporting facilities. As with the MRF data sets, only the weighted average data sets can be shown in order to protect the confidentiality of individual facility data sets. Assumptions and calculations are described in Modeling Constants and the supporting documentation.\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION\r\nNo uncertainty estimations were included.","restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

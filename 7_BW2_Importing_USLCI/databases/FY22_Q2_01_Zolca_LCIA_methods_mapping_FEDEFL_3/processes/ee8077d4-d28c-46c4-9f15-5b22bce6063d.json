No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.\r\n","restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

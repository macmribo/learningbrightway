Membrane cell electrolysis is the most recent of the Chlor-alkali technologies. The membrane cell is named as such since the anode and cathodes are separated by a perfluoropolymer cation exchange membrane. Saturated brine solution is passed through the anode compartment of the cell, where the chloride ions are oxidized into chlorine gas.  The electric field causes sodium ions to pass through the membrane to the cathode.  Due to the oxidation of the water, hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions form and produce sodium hydroxide at the cathode. According to The Chlorine Institute, \" membrane electrolyzers typically produce 30% to 35% sodium hydroxide,\" which is then concentrated using evaporators. A 50% solution is typical from this process and is a co-product in the Chlor-alkali process. Hydrogen can be captured for use as a fuel or material input, sold as a coproduct, or released to the air depending on the chlor-alkali plant.","dataCollectionDescription":"All primary data were collected for 2015 or 2017.","completenessDescription":"Data evaluation procedures and criteria were applied consistently to all primary data provided by the participating producers for all data collected. All primary data obtained specifically for this study were considered the most representative available for the systems studied. Data sets were reviewed for completeness and material balances, and follow-up was conducted as needed to resolve any questions about the input and output flows, process technology, etc. The aggregated averaged datasets were also reviewed by the providing companies as compared to the provided dataset. Companies were requested to review whether their data were complete and to comment about their or the average dataset.","dataSelectionDescription":"All Chlor-alkali production data was sourced from primary producers.","reviewDetails":"The data providers reviewed their data and the average. The Vinyl Institute and some ACC members are currently reviewing the associated report.

Three main coproducts (chlorine, sodium hydroxide and hydrogen) are produced during the Chlor-alkali process and allocation was performed after the average was created. Mass allocation was used to allocate all inputs and outputs to each product and co-product with the following exceptions:  \n •\tThe sodium chloride input was given stoichiometric allocation among the three products. As the plants providing data produced for sale only chlorine, sodium hydroxide and hydrogen, the sodium chloride input was split between the chlorine and sodium hydroxide using the stoichiometry of the chemical reaction. \n•\tThe sulfuric acid input was used specifically to dry the chlorine and so has fully been allocated to the chlorine product.\n•\tAll chlorine-based air emissions or waterborne wastes are allocated to the chlorine product.\n•\tAll sodium hydroxide emissions are allocated to the sodium hydroxide product.\n•\tAll hydrogen emissions are allocated to the hydrogen product. \nAlthough some chemicals are produced within the chlor-alkali plant (e.g. hydrochloric acid), they are not considered a coproduct. The average chlor-alkali dataset was reviewed and accepted respectively by each data provider.","inventoryMethodDescription":"Attributional; Compatible with TRACI","modelingConstantsDescription":"LCI data for the production of sodium hydroxide were collected from three producers (three plants) in North America – all in the United States.

A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model. For this process the data sets are based on actual plant data reported by plant personnel. Supporting background data were drawn from credible, widely used databases including the US LCI database, GREET, and Ecoinvent, as well as secondary data sources.\n\nUNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION: Primary data collected from actual facilities are considered the best available data for representing industry operations. In this study, primary data were used to model the sodium hydroxide production. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.","restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

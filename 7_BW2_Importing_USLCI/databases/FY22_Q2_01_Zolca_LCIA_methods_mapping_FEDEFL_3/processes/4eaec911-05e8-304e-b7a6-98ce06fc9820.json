The data for hydrogen production are estimates of the synthesis gas production. Raw material inputs for hydrogen are based on the conversion of methane to carbon monoxide and hydrogen.  The carbon dioxide emissions include those from the shift reaction as well as from the combustion of the portion of processed natural gas used as feedstock that becomes PSA offgas that is burned and used as process energy.  Complete inventory data and metadata are available in full in the final report and appendices, Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates and has undergone partial critical review by ACC Plastics Division members and is available at: www.americanchemistry.com. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and and this module due to rounding.  Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.

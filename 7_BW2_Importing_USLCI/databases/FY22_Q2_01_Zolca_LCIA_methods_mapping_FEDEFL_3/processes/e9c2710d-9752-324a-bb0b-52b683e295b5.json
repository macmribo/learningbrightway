The foam then expands and fills the cavity between the metal skins as they enter a platen conveyor. Panels are then cut to length with an in-line cross cut saw. Post fabrication work, available through some manufacturers, can be performed on the product to treat the cut ends of the panels.  The IMP production process includes all material and inbound transportation necessary for construction-ready products: coated steel coils, foaming agents, and packaging materials.  Energy and utility inputs include electricity, natural gas, and propane.  All known solid waste, air, and water emissions are captured in the output.","version":"00.02.012","lastChange":"2021-04-07T11:30:56.016-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"283000ef-b319-3fff-a137-5116b70f8797","name":"3323: Architectural and Structural Metals Manufacturing","categoryPath":["31-33: Manufacturing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","technologyDescription":"Insulated metal panel (IMP) for external building surfaces.

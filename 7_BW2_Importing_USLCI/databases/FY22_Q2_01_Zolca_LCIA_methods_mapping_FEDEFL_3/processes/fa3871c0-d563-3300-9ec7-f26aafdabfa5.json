{"@context":"http://greendelta.github.io/olca-schema/context.jsonld","@type":"Process","@id":"fa3871c0-d563-3300-9ec7-f26aafdabfa5","name":"Propylene oxide, at plant","description":"The environmental emissions and raw materials for this module are a weighted average of the three technologies.  The chlorohydrin process generates 42.1 percent of the propylene oxide, the isobutene hydroperoxidation (including MTBE hydroperoxidation) 34.6 percent, and the ethylbenzene hydroperoxidation 23.3 percent.  In the two hydroperoxidation datasets, coproduct credit was given on a mass basis.  This data module is a weighted average of the inventory for several technologies. An excess amount of brine water is produced during one of the technologies but is not presented as an output to nature; these output amounts would likely explain the upset in the mass balance shown for this hybrid inventory.  Complete inventory data and metadata are available in full in the final report and appendices, Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates and has undergone partial critical review by ACC Plastics Division members and is available at: www.americanchemistry.com. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and and this module due to rounding.  Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.

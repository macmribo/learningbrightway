Natural gas is extracted from deep underground wells and is frequently co-produced with crude oil. Because of its gaseous nature, natural gas flows quite freely from wells which produce primarily natural gas, but some energy is required to pump natural gas and crude oil mixtures to the surface. An estimated 80 percent of natural gas is extracted onshore and 20 percent is extracted offshore. Atmospheric emissions from natural gas production result primarily from unflared venting, as well as fugitive CO2 emissions. Sulfur was given no coproduct allocation in this process.\r\n","version":"00.00.022","lastChange":"2019-10-02T11:12:32.953-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"b22278b5-8607-3d1e-8456-ef3fd9a84857","name":"2111: Oil and Gas Extraction","categoryPath":["21: Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"0b3b97fa-6688-3c56-88ee-4ae80ec0c3c2","name":"United States"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"","technologyDescription":"Unconventinal natural gas processing for fuel use","dataCollectionDescription":"NETL LCA Unit Process Library, Natural gas extraction processes 2014.","completenessDescription":"TREATMENT OF MISSING ENVIRONMENTAL DATA: Elementary flows are cut-off at less than 1% based on environmental relevance.\r\nTREATMENT OF MISSING TECHNOSPHERE DATA: Intermediate flows are cut-off is at 1%  based on environmental relevance.\r\nMASS BALANCE: The mass balance was calculated by a straight comparison of inputs and outputs.","dataSelectionDescription":"This process contributes to the natural gas processing production mix process based on the extraction method and its percentage share in the US natural gas production mix.

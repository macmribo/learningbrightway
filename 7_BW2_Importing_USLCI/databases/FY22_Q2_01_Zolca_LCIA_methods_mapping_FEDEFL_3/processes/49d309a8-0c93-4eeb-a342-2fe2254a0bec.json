Numerous co-product streams are produced during this process. Fuel gas and off-gas are two coproducts produced that are exported to another process for fuel use. When the fuel coproducts are exported from the hydrocracker, they carry with them the allocated share of the inputs and outputs for their production. The ratio of the mass of the exported fuel over the total mass output is removed from the total inputs and outputs of the hydrocracker, and the remaining inputs and outputs are allocated over the material hydrocracker products. No energy credit is applied for the exported fuels, since both the inputs and outputs for the exported fuels have been removed from the data set. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and and this module due to rounding. Representativeness: 100%.  The olefins producers who provided data for this module verified that the characteristics of their plants are representative of a majority of North American olefins production\r\n\r\nThe captured propylene production amount is approximately 10 percent of the ethylene production in the U.S. in 2015 (Oil and Gas Journal, 2017).  The captured propylene production amount is estimated to be 4 percent of the total propylene production in the U.S. in 2015 (Oil and Gas Journal, 2017). Propylene, pyrolysis gasoline and butadiene are coproducts of ethylene production, and a mass basis was used to allocate the credit for the coproducts. Differences in this dataset and the dataset of other olefins are due to the use of the production amount to weight each plant\u0027s data. For coproducts sold for fuel use in other processes, these were treated as an avoided fuel product and were given credits based on the fuel they would replace.\r\n","version":"00.00.070","lastChange":"2021-01-08T01:00:30.702-07:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"01fd1e94-45bd-3239-8d50-7d7488c1cac4","name":"3241: Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing","categoryPath":["31-33: Manufacturing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"NO_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"Northern America"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"All primary data were collected from 2014-2015","technologyDescription":"Propylene mainly comes from steam cracking or as a by-product of refining, although some propylene is created through propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, methanol synthesis, and coal to olefins. This average dataset represents steam cracking only. Typical steam cracking begins when hydrocarbons are fed to the cracking furnace. After being pre-heated by a heat exchanger, mixed with steam and then further heated, the hydrocarbon feed is transferred to a reactor.   The temperature is again increased to around 800 Celsius, and the cracked gas products are immediately cooled in quench towers using quench oil or quench water. Fuel oil is separated from the main gas stream in a multi-stage centrifugal compressor. The main gas stream then undergoes acid gas removal and drying to remove any moisture that may remain from the quenching process prior to cracked gas compression. The final step involves fractional distillation of the various reaction products and is achieved using a series of distillation columns and hydrogenation reactors.","dataCollectionDescription":"All primary data were collected from 2015.

A weighted average was calculated from the data collected and used to develop the LCA model.

In this study, primary data were used to model the steam cracking of the olefins. All data received were carefully evaluated before compiling the production-weighted average data sets used to generate results. No uncertainty analysis was carried out due to the lack of uncertainty data or probability distributions for key parameters, which are often only available as single point estimates from the producers.\r\n","restrictionsDescription":"These U.S. LCI Database Project data (\"Data\") are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (\"Alliance\") for the US Department of Energy (\"DOE\") under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

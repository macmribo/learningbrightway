Mechanical extraction may be carried out in either a single-or double-press system. Data for this module assumes only one-third of all crude palm kernel oil is produced by way of a double-press system. The remainder was assumed produced from a single-press system.  Cake and pellets are produced as coproducts. Mass partitioning was used to give credit to these coproducts.  Complete inventory data and metadata are available in full in the final report and appendices, Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates and has undergone partial critical review by ACC Plastics Division members and is available at: www.americanchemistry.com. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and and this module due to rounding.  Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.

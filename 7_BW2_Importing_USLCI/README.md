# Importing USLCI

These notebooks describe my journey trying to get USLCI to work with Brightway2. I created the notebooks in the following order:
* **1_My_little_database_bw2:** Here I tried to manually add a super tiny database `My little database` which consists on three unit processes interconnected. My goal here was to understand the data fields I need in Brightway2 to replicate the tiny dataset that I originally generated with OpenLCA.
* **2_My_little_database_JSON-LD_Import:** Here, I use the J
* **3_JSON-LD_Import-FY22_Q2_01_Zolca:**

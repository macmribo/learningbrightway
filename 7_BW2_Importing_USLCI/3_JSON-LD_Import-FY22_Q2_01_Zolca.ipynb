This function identifies `PRODUCT_FLOW` in the outputs so it can get the units of the reference flow, however, there are processes with more than one `PRODUCT_FLOW`. I think what it is forcing is to have one as the \"reference flow\" thus it might be confusing reference flow with production flow. I changed the code increasing the `if` statement adding `quantitativeReference`, so it knows that which flow is the reference product to 'borrow' its units. The fix: added `& (exc.get('quantitativeReference') is True`.\n",
